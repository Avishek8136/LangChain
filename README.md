# LangChain Environment Workspace

This workspace is set up to explore and learn LangChain for building multi-agent models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, with guidance and resources provided by Krish Naik.

## Objectives
1. **Learn LangChain**: Understand the basics and advanced features of LangChain, including its modules, components, and how it facilitates interaction with various language models.
2. **Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Explore how LangChain can be used to combine retrieval techniques with language generation, allowing models to access and leverage external data for context-aware responses.
3. **Develop Multi-Agent Models**: Experiment with LangChainâ€™s capabilities in creating multi-agent models that collaborate, communicate, and perform complex tasks.

## Sample Bot
A sample bot has been created using the Azure OpenAI service and LangChain, which showcases how to integrate the LangChain framework with cloud-based models for building intelligent, context-aware applications. You can try the bot at:

[Sample Bot - Azure OpenAI Service with LangChain](https://langchainazureopenai.streamlit.app/)

This bot utilizes LangChain's agent functionalities and connects to the Azure OpenAI service for natural language understanding and generation, providing a practical example of the power of both LangChain and the Azure cloud platform.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Verify the installation by running a simple LangChain script, such as initializing a basic chain.

## Key Resources
- **Official LangChain Documentation**: Provides comprehensive guides on each module.
- **Tutorials by Krish Naik**: Personalized resources and examples to understand multi-agent model concepts in LangChain.
- **Sample Bot**: Experience the sample bot using Azure OpenAI via [this link](https://langchainazureopenai.streamlit.app/).

## Usage
- Use `notebooks/` for hands-on practice with LangChain concepts, including RAG and multi-agent modeling.
- `models/` will contain custom configurations for RAG workflows and multi-agent setups.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Gain familiarity with LangChain's core functionality.
- **Phase 2**: Experiment with RAG implementations.
- **Phase 3**: Build and fine-tune a multi-agent system for a specific task or use case.
